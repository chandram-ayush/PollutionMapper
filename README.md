Introduction
PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, which can pose serious health risks when present in high concentrations in the air. Predictive modeling of PM2.5 concentration plays a crucial role in environmental monitoring and public health management.

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict PM2.5 concentration based on various environmental and meteorological variables.

Folder Structure
CSV_Data: Contains CSV files for training and test data.
PM25_data: Contains NetCDF files for PM2.5 data.
models: Contains saved trained models.
README.md: Readme file describing the project.
main.py: Main Python script for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies.
Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xarray
matplotlib
seaborn
netCDF4
scipy
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
Place the training and test data CSV files in the CSV_Data directory.
Place the PM2.5 data NetCDF files in the PM25_data directory.
Run the main.py script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will preprocess the data, train machine learning models, evaluate the models, and generate visualizations.
Results
The project generates machine learning models to predict PM2.5 concentration based on environmental variables. The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score (R2).
